Step 2: Identify the data sources - Explore potential data sources such as: - Internal databases or systems (e.g., inventory management system, purchase order system) - External sources (e.g., industry reports, competitor information) - Surveys or interviews with relevant stakeholders (e.g., stock managers, employees involved in the sourcing process) Step 3: Determine the data collection methods - Decide on the best methods for collecting relevant data, considering factors such as time, cost, and accuracy: - Extract data from internal databases or systems: Identify the necessary data fields and establish a process for data extraction. - Collect external data sources: Gather industry reports, competitor information, or any relevant third-party data. - Conduct surveys or interviews: Prepare a questionnaire or interview guide to collect qualitative and quantitative insights from stakeholders. Step 4: Clean and validate the data - Perform data cleaning and validation to ensure accuracy and consistency: - Remove any duplicate records or irrelevant data. - Handle missing values by imputation or considering their impact on the analysis. - Validate data against predefined criteria to identify any inconsistencies or outliers. Step 5: Calculate the metric 'time spent on sourcing stock per unit of stock' - Determine the formula for calculating the metric, based on the available data. - Calculate the time spent on sourcing stock per unit of stock for each relevant dataset or dimension (e.g., by product, by supplier, by location). - Aggregate the results to obtain an overall picture of the sourcing process efficiency. Step 6: Explore relationships and patterns - Perform exploratory data analysis to identify any trends, patterns, or correlations between the metric and other variables: - Use statistical methods and visualization techniques to analyze the data. - Examine relationships between the time spent metric and factors such as product type, supplier, location, or any other relevant variables. - Identify any notable variations or outliers that may shed light on specific areas of improvement or success. Step 7: Identify opportunities for improvement - Analyze the findings to pinpoint areas of inefficiency and opportunities for improvement: - Compare the metric across different categories or dimensions to identify variations. - Identify potential bottlenecks or factors affecting the time spent on sourcing stock. - Look for any specific patterns or correlations that suggest areas for improvement. Step 8: Provide recommendations - Based on the analysis, develop actionable recommendations for decision-makers: - Present the findings and highlight areas of success and issues. - Provide specific recommendations on how to reduce the time spent on sourcing stock, increase productivity, and improve efficiency. - Consider the feasibility, impact, and cost-effectiveness of each recommendation. Step 9: Monitor and evaluate - Establish a process for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the metric: - Set up regular data collection and analysis to track changes in the time spent metric over time. - Monitor the implementation and impact of the recommendations. - Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions or improvements made. Step 10: Iterate and refine - Continuously refine the analysis plan based on feedback, new data sources, or changing business needs: - Incorporate new data sources or metrics as they become available. - Adapt the analysis plan to address emerging challenges or insights. - Repeat the analysis periodically to track progress and identify new opportunities.\"},\n",

      "You are an expert data analyst creating an analysis plan for a company you're helping in the {industry} industry. For this analysis plan, you're investigating this metric: Time spent on sourcing stock per unit of stock. In your opinion, who would be the best person in the company to present this analysis plan to in order to have the greatest impact at the company? Define their role in the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to have the greatest impact at the company, the best person to present the analysis plan to would be the Chief Operating Officer (COO) or the Director of Operations. The COO or Director of Operations is responsible for overseeing the overall operations of the company, including inventory management, procurement, and supply chain management. They have the authority and decision-making power to implement changes and allocate resources within the company. Presenting the analysis plan to the COO or Director of Operations will help ensure that the insights and recommendations are considered at a strategic level. They can assess the operational impact of the analysis, allocate resources accordingly, and make decisions that will optimize the time spent on sourcing stock per unit of stock.\n",

      "1. The prompt assumes that the divs and URLs have already been defined and extracted, which could be a limitation if this information is missing or not provided.\n",
      "2. The prompt does not specify the purpose or next steps after obtaining the URLs, which could make it challenging for the AI to provide a comprehensive response.\n",
      "3. The prompt does not provide any context or explanation about the overall objective or desired outcome, making it harder for the AI to provide a tailored and insightful response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt effectively conveys the task at hand, but there are specific details that could have been included to enhance the AI's response.\n",
      "Pros of the prompt:\n",
      "1. The prompt clearly describes the desired outcome and provides specific details about the structure and format of the data, making it easier for the AI to understand and generate an appropriate response.\n",
      "2. The prompt includes a specific code snippet, which helps the AI understand the context and generate a more relevant response.\n",
      "3. The prompt provides a clear question, asking how to loop through the data and extract the URL and ASIN, which allows the AI to focus on providing a solution to the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons of the prompt:\n",
      "1. The prompt does not provide any background information or context about the purpose or goal of the data extraction and analysis. This could make it difficult for the AI to provide suggestions or recommendations beyond the specific question asked.\n",
      "2. The prompt does not specify any constraints or limitations, such as the programming language or framework to be used, making it less clear how the AI should approach the problem.\n",
      "3. The prompt does not mention the desired output or further analysis to be performed on the extracted data, which limits the AI's ability to provide a comprehensive solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt is effective at obtaining useful information from the AI large language model. It provides specific details and a clear question, allowing the AI to focus on providing a solution to the problem at hand. However, it could be further improved by providing more context, constraints, and specifying desired outputs or analysis requirements.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. The prompt is clear and specific, providing the necessary context for the AI to understand the issue.\n",
      "2. The prompt describes the problem of getting 'None' values for price, rating, and review count, which helps the AI focus on finding a solution to this particular issue.\n",
      "3. The prompt requests the AI to review both the prompt and response, ensuring that the AI evaluates its own output, promoting self-assessment and learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The prompt could provide more information about the specific method or tool being used for data collection and analysis. This would help the AI provide more tailored and relevant solutions.\n",
      "2. The prompt does not mention the website or platform where the data is being collected from, which could be important for the AI to provide accurate suggestions or solutions.\n",
      "3. The prompt could specify the desired outcome or goal of the data collection and analysis, which would help the AI provide more targeted advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt effectively highlights the problem at hand and requests the AI to review its own response, providing an opportunity for improvement. However, providing more specific context and goals would enhance the effectiveness of the interaction with the AI.\n"
