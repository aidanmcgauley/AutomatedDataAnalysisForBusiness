       "  'response': \"To clean the data so that it can be plotted, you need to first understand the nature of your columns and the type of plots you want to generate. Here are a few general steps you could take: Convert data types: Convert columns to their appropriate data types for better analysis and visualization. For example, if a column should be numeric but is currently being treated as a string, you would want to convert it to a numeric type. Handle missing values: If a column has missing values, you need to decide how to handle them. You might fill them with a default value (like the mean or median), interpolate them based on other rows, or drop rows or columns with missing values. Clean string data: If a column contains string data, ensure it's consistently formatted. You might want to strip leading/trailing whitespace, convert to lowercase for consistency, or replace certain values. Handle outliers: Depending on the nature of your data and the type of analysis you're doing, you might want to handle outliers. This could involve capping values at a certain maximum, normalizing or scaling your data, or even removing these rows. Create categorical data: For some plots, you might want to convert numeric data into categorical data. For example, you might create a 'Size' category that includes 'Small', 'Medium', and 'Large' based on the values in a 'Revenue' column. Let's start by converting some columns to their appropriate types. For instance, it seems like columns such as Fixed Assets(CUR) , Net Fixed Assets(CUR) , Current Assets(CUR) , Creditors(CUR) , Equity(CUR) , Employees(CUR) , Fixed Assets(PREV) , Net Fixed Assets(PREV) , Current Assets(PREV) , Creditors(PREV) , Equity(PREV) , and Employees(PREV) could be converted to numerical types.

As expected, there are many missing values (represented as NaN ) in these columns due to the conversion of 'Not Available' entries. Next, you can handle missing data based on the specific requirements of your analysis. One common approach is to fill in missing values with the mean or median of the column, or to simply drop rows with missing data if they are not significant for your analysis. Please note that the way you handle missing data can significantly impact your results, so it's important to make thoughtful choices here. Let me know what you would like to do next.\"},\n",

Finished working Show work I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems there was an issue with the system that caused the state of the code execution to reset, leading to a loss of the data that had been loaded. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the current environment, I'm unable to reload the data. However, I can guide you on how to create an 'Age' column based on the 'Incorporated on' column. Here's how you could do it in Python: python Copy code # First, make sure the 'Incorporated on' column is in the datetime format data[ 'Incorporated on' ] = pd.to_datetime(data[ 'Incorporated on' ]) # Then, subtract the 'Incorporated on' dates from the current date to get the age of the company data[ 'Age' ] = (pd.Timestamp.now() - data[ 'Incorporated on' ]).dt.days // 365 This code will create a new column 'Age' in the DataFrame data that contains the age of each company in years. Please try this code in your local environment and let me know if you encounter any issues.\"}]"

      "3. The prompt does not explicitly mention any constraints or limitations on the cleaning process, potentially leaving the AI's response open-ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt is fairly effective in obtaining useful information from the AI large language model. It clearly defines the problem, specifies the desired objectives, and invites the AI to provide relevant recommendations. However, providing more specific details about the dataset and any existing preprocessing steps could improve the quality of the response.\n",
