       "  'response': \" <ChatGPT4-with  WebPilot  plugin> I can certainly assist you with this task. However, please note that gathering such specific and detailed information might be challenging due to the following reasons: Not all companies publicly disclose their number of employees, revenue, or market share. This information might be available for public companies, but private companies often keep this information confidential. Pricing and product range can change frequently and might not be available on all company websites. Market share information is typically available through market research reports, which are often paid resources.

Here's how we can approach this: Identify companies in Ireland and the UK that manufacture, refurbish, or sell vintage banjos. Visit each company's website to gather information about their location, product range, and pricing.

      "2. The prompt provides specific instructions on what data categories are required, such as company name, location, industry, size, website, description, number of employees, number of followers, and so on.\n",
      "3. The prompt includes detailed instructions on how to collect data from LinkedIn and Glassdoor, specifying the types of information that can be scraped from these websites.\n",
      "4. The prompt also specifies the specific keywords to search for in order to obtain relevant data, such as luthiery, luther, musical instrument factory, and musical instrument retail/wholesale jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The prompt could have been more explicit in stating the specific purpose or analysis that the gathered data will be used for, which could help the AI provide more targeted and relevant information.\n",
      "2. The prompt did not mention any specific time frame or geographical scope for the research, which may result in a wide range of search results and potentially irrelevant data.\n",
      "3. The prompt does not specify any preferences or requirements regarding the credibility or accuracy of the data scraped from LinkedIn or Glassdoor, which may lead to potential issues with data reliability.\n",
      "4. The prompt does not provide any instructions on how the data should be formatted or organized, which may require additional effort to clean and structure the gathered data for analysis purposes.\n",
      "5. The prompt does not mention any limitations or potential challenges in data collection, such as limitations of the AI or potential difficulties in scraping data from specific websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt provides a good starting point for obtaining useful data from the AI large language model, but could benefit from additional clarity and specificity in order to ensure the best possible results for the data analysis project.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. The prompt clearly outlines the objective of gathering financial data about small banjo companies who aren't publicly traded.\n",
      "2. The prompt specifies the UK report predicting a 2.5% revenue growth in 2023, indicating a specific source of data.\n",
      "3. The prompt provides clear instructions on what information is needed and asks for the most important figures.\n",
      "4. The AI response provides multiple suggestions for gathering data, including company information websites, industry reports, and news articles.\n",
      "5. The AI response provides specific examples of important figures from the UK report predicting revenue growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The AI response does not provide direct methods or sources for gathering financial data about small banjo companies specifically. Instead, it suggests sources for general industry data.\n",
      "2. The AI response relies on the user to investigate and extract data, which may require additional time and effort.\n",
      "3. The AI response does not address the challenge of obtaining financial data for non-publicly traded banjo companies specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt and response are effective in providing general suggestions for gathering data about the banjo industry, but they may not fully address the specific requirement of obtaining financial data for small banjo companies who are not publicly traded. Further refinement and narrowing of the scope may be necessary to gather the desired information effectively.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. The prompt provides clear and specific metrics that the human is interested in obtaining data on. This helps guide the AI in generating a relevant response.\n",
      "2. The prompt is structured in a way that allows the AI to provide specific information, such as average prices and timeframes, which can be useful for the data analysis project.\n",
      "3. The prompt includes a variety of metrics, covering different aspects of the vintage banjo industry, which can provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The prompt could have provided more context or background information about the vintage banjo industry. This would have helped the AI generate a more informed and detailed response.\n",
      "2. The prompt does not indicate the specific sources or databases the human wants the AI to retrieve data from. This could potentially limit the accuracy and reliability of the generated response.\n",
      "3. The prompt does not specify any desired comparisons or analyses to be conducted on the obtained data. This might make it difficult for the AI to provide insights or recommendations beyond the basic information requested.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. The prompt asks the AI for specific information related to the vintage banjo industry, allowing the AI to focus its search and provide relevant data.\n",
      "2. The prompt asks the AI to find evidence and examples related to musicians' beliefs about higher prices equating to higher quality, as well as any challenges to this belief within the industry. This helps in gathering different perspectives and potential counterarguments.\n",
      "3. The prompt also asks for suggestions on how the owner of a banjo business could encourage musicians to trust their ears when making purchasing decisions. This can help gather practical ideas and recommendations for the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The prompt does not specify the time frame or scope of the research, which could affect the accuracy or relevance of the information provided by the AI.\n",
      "2. While the prompt focuses on a specific topic within the vintage banjo industry, it does not provide any specific research questions or hypothesis, which could limit the AI's ability to provide targeted and comprehensive data.\n",
      "3. The prompt assumes that the AI can provide direct information or examples about challenging the belief that higher prices mean higher quality, but there is no guarantee that such specific information is readily available in the AI's dataset.\n",
      "4. The prompt does not specify the desired format or depth of data required, which could result in a wide range of information, some of which may not be useful for the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt provides a good starting point for obtaining data from the AI large language model, but it could benefit from refining the research questions, specifying the scope, and being more explicit about the desired format or depth of data.\n"
